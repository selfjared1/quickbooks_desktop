# quickbooks_desktop
A Python 3 library for QuickBooks Desktop API.

This project is a work in process as of this writing.  <br>
The purpose of the project is to make QuickBooks <br>
Desktop's API more accessable in Python. This libary <br>
uses QBXML instead of QBFC. <br>
<br>
###Python 32 Bit vs. 64 Bit
Until 2022, QuickBooks was a 32 bit program.  Because <br>
of this you will need to us a 32 bit version of Python <br>
in order for this library to work if you're using any <br>
version below 2022 (or 22.0 for Enterprise).<br>

###Instructions
This library will handle all of the complexities with Session <br>
managment
