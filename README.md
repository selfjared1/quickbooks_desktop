<h1>quickbooks_desktop</h1> 
A Python 3 library for QuickBooks Desktop API.

The purpose of the project is to make QuickBooks <br>
Desktop more accessible in Python. This library <br>
uses QBXML instead of QBFC. <br>
<br>
<h2>Python 32 Bit vs. 64 Bit</h2>
Until 2022, QuickBooks was a 32 bit program.  Because <br>
of this, you will need to use a 32 bit version of Python. <br>
In 2022 QuickBooks did upgrade to 64 bit so if you're using <br>
QuickBooks version 2022 (or 22.0 for Enterprise) then <br>
a 64 bit version of Python may work.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
This package will handle all the complexities of dealing with<br>
Session Manager.
